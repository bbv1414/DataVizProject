# DataVizProject
As we continue to work on the project, we were able to complete a good amount of the work. We were able to complete the world map, tooltip for the world map, and the gauge.
We are still in the process of completing the radar chart and pre-processing the data for all the countries to be symmetrical with its values.
Our project started by consisting of a world map, a guage to display per country to show the overall happiness in the country, and a radar chart to display 
per country that is clicked upon that will display all the attributes and how they vary per country. We are currently still on pace to complete all these graphs
and have no changed our plan in anyway. The original data is located at https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2019.csv but we decided to change the 
data to be scaled evenly for all the attributes so it looks better but is still consistent throughout.
